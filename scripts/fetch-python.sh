# Fetch a relocatable, self-contained CPython for bundling into F-Chat.app.
#
# Agent Skills frequently ship `.py` helper scripts, and an end-user Mac is not
# guaranteed to have a system `python3`. We bundle a standalone CPython (from
# the astral-sh/python-build-standalone project) so `run_code` can execute
# Python regardless of the user's machine. The runtime is relocatable, which
# keeps the sandbox profile's read scope bounded to the bundled directory.
#
# Output: vendor/python3/  (a `bin/python3` + its libraries). Cached — re-runs
# are a no-op once present. make-app.sh copies this into the .app bundle.
